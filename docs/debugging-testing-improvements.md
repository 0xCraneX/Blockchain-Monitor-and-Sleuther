# Debugging and Testing Improvements

## Summary

Based on the issues encountered during deployment (WebSocket CORS errors, BigInt conversion failures, server accessibility problems), I've implemented a comprehensive testing and debugging strategy that would have caught these issues before they reached production.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Enhanced Logging System**
- Created `src/utils/logger.js` with method entry/exit tracking
- Added performance monitoring for all operations
- Database query logging with parameterized statements
- WebSocket event tracking
- Real-time log monitoring script (`scripts/monitor-logs.js`)

### 2. **Browser-Based E2E Testing**
- Implemented Playwright tests that run in real browsers
- Tests from multiple origins (localhost, 127.0.0.1)
- Console error monitoring
- Network request/response validation
- WebSocket connection testing

### 3. **Specific Test Coverage**

#### CORS and WebSocket Tests (`tests/e2e/cors-websocket.spec.js`)
- Tests connections from different origins
- Validates CORS headers on all endpoints
- Checks WebSocket origin validation
- Tests with missing origin headers

#### Data Edge Cases (`tests/e2e/data-edge-cases.spec.js`)
- Decimal values in BigInt conversions
- Scientific notation handling
- Extreme numeric values
- Concurrent request handling
- Malformed request resilience

#### Console Monitoring (`tests/e2e/browser-console-monitor.spec.js`)
- Captures all console errors
- Detects CSP violations
- Monitors network failures
- Tracks WebSocket lifecycle
- Provides detailed error reports

#### Smoke Tests (`tests/e2e/smoke-test.spec.js`)
- Full application startup validation
- Different HOST binding tests
- Resource loading verification
- API response time checks
- Graceful shutdown testing

### 4. **Pre-Deployment Validation**
- Created `scripts/pre-deployment-check.js`
- Automated checks for all critical issues
- Server accessibility from multiple hosts
- WebSocket CORS validation
- Security header verification
- Data handling edge cases

### 5. **CI/CD Integration**
- GitHub Actions workflow for comprehensive testing
- Matrix testing across browsers and origins
- Automatic console error detection
- Pre-deployment validation gates
- Security vulnerability scanning

## How These Would Have Caught Our Issues

### WebSocket CORS Error
**Issue**: Browser connections from 127.0.0.1 were blocked
**Detection**:
- `cors-websocket.spec.js` tests connections from both localhost and 127.0.0.1
- `pre-deployment-check.js` validates WebSocket from multiple origins
- CI/CD matrix tests different origin combinations

### BigInt Conversion Error
**Issue**: Decimal values caused "Cannot convert to BigInt" errors
**Detection**:
- `data-edge-cases.spec.js` specifically tests decimal values
- Property-based testing for numeric boundaries
- Pre-deployment check includes decimal value handling

### Server Accessibility
**Issue**: Server bound to localhost wasn't accessible
**Detection**:
- `smoke-test.spec.js` tests different HOST bindings
- Pre-deployment check validates accessibility from multiple hosts
- CI/CD tests with different HOST configurations

### Console Errors
**Issue**: CSP violations and missing resources only visible in browser
**Detection**:
- `browser-console-monitor.spec.js` captures all console output
- Specific CSP violation detection
- Resource loading validation

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Test in Real Browser Context**
   - Don't rely solely on Node.js tests
   - Use actual browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
   - Monitor console output during tests

2. **Test Multiple Access Patterns**
   - localhost vs 127.0.0.1 vs IP address
   - Different ports and protocols
   - Various origin headers

3. **Edge Case Data Testing**
   - Use property-based testing
   - Test boundary values
   - Include malformed/unexpected inputs

4. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Real-time log analysis
   - Performance tracking
   - Error aggregation and reporting

5. **Pre-Deployment Gates**
   - Automated validation before deployment
   - Comprehensive checklist execution
   - Clear pass/fail criteria

## Usage

### Run All E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
npm run test:e2e:cors      # CORS and WebSocket tests
npm run test:e2e:console   # Console error monitoring
npm run test:e2e:edge      # Data edge cases
npm run test:e2e:smoke     # Smoke tests
```

### Pre-Deployment Check
```bash
npm run precheck           # Run all pre-deployment validations
npm run test:predeploy     # Lint + All tests + Pre-deployment check
```

### Debug Failed Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug     # Run tests with Playwright inspector
npm run test:e2e:headed    # Run tests with visible browser
npm run playwright:report  # View detailed test report
```

### Monitor Logs
```bash
npm run logs:debug         # Monitor all debug logs
npm run logs:error         # Monitor only errors
npm run logs:ws           # Monitor WebSocket events
npm run logs:stats        # Show log statistics
```

## Conclusion

These improvements create a robust safety net that catches issues before they reach production. The combination of comprehensive logging, browser-based testing, and pre-deployment validation ensures that common deployment issues are detected early in the development cycle.
