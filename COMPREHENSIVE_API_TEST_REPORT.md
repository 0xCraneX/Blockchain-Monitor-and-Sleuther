# Comprehensive API Test Report

## Test Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-11  
**API Base URL**: http://[::1]:3000/api  
**Total Tests**: 55  
**Passed**: 22 (40.00%)  
**Failed**: 33 (60.00%)  

## Test Results by Category

### 1. Root API Tests
- **Status**: ✅ All Passed (1/1)
- **Details**: Basic API info endpoint working correctly

### 2. Address API Tests
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially Working (14/21 passed)
- **Working Features**:
  - Search endpoint with valid/invalid queries
  - Invalid address validation (returns 400 as expected)
  - Transfers endpoint for valid Polkadot addresses
  - Relationships endpoint for valid Polkadot addresses
  - Patterns endpoint for valid Polkadot addresses
  
- **Issues Found**:
  - Bitcoin-format addresses (e.g., `1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa`) are rejected with validation error
  - Valid Polkadot addresses return 404 "Address not found" when fetching address details
  - Empty address parameter returns 404 instead of 400

### 3. Graph API Tests
- **Status**: ❌ Major Issues (0/21 passed)
- **Issues Found**:
  - Invalid address format returns 400 "not a valid Substrate address"
  - Valid addresses return 404 "Address not found in database"
  - Rate limiting kicks in quickly (429 Too Many Requests)
  - All graph endpoints fail due to either validation or rate limiting

### 4. Relationships API Tests
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partially Working (1/3 passed)
- **Issues Found**:
  - Only works with proper Polkadot addresses
  - Bitcoin-format addresses rejected

### 5. Investigations API Tests
- **Status**: ✅ Working Well (2/3 passed)
- **Working Features**:
  - Proper validation for missing fields
  - Creates investigations with valid data
- **Issues Found**:
  - One test failed (likely due to invalid address format)

### 6. Stats API Tests
- **Status**: ✅ All Passed (1/1)
- **Details**: Returns expected statistics structure

### 7. Rate Limiting Tests
- **Status**: ✅ Working Correctly (1/1)
- **Details**: Rate limiting triggers after 19 requests as expected

### 8. Concurrent Request Tests
- **Status**: ❌ Failed (0/1)
- **Details**: Only 3/10 concurrent requests succeeded, likely due to rate limiting

### 9. Error Handling Tests
- **Status**: ⚠️ Mostly Working (2/3 passed)
- **Working Features**:
  - 404 for non-existent endpoints
  - 404 for unsupported methods
- **Issues Found**:
  - Path traversal attempt returns 404 instead of 400

## Key Findings

### 1. Address Validation Issues
- The API only accepts Substrate/Polkadot format addresses
- Bitcoin and other format addresses are rejected
- This limits testing with diverse address formats

### 2. Empty Database
- Most valid addresses return 404 "not found"
- The database appears to be empty or not properly seeded
- This prevents testing of actual data retrieval

### 3. Aggressive Rate Limiting
- Rate limiting triggers quickly (after ~19 requests)
- This interferes with comprehensive testing
- Graph API endpoints are particularly affected

### 4. Response Times
- Most endpoints respond very quickly (2-4ms)
- Address lookup endpoints take longer (60-70ms)
- Overall performance is good

### 5. Error Handling
- Validation errors return proper 400 status with detailed messages
- 404 errors are properly handled
- Error response format is consistent

## Recommendations

1. **Seed Database**: Add test data to enable full API testing
2. **Address Format Support**: Consider supporting multiple blockchain address formats
3. **Rate Limit Adjustment**: Increase rate limits for development/testing environments
4. **Graph API Fix**: Debug why all graph endpoints fail
5. **Documentation**: Update API docs to clarify supported address formats
6. **Path Traversal**: Improve security by returning 400 for path traversal attempts

## Security Observations

- ✅ Rate limiting is implemented
- ✅ Input validation is working
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ CORS and security headers present
- ⚠️ Path traversal returns 404 instead of 400

## Performance Metrics

- Average response time: 3-4ms for most endpoints
- Address lookups: 60-70ms
- Rate limit threshold: ~19 requests per window
- Concurrent request handling: Limited by rate limiting

## Conclusion

The API is partially functional with good error handling and security measures. The main issues are:
1. Empty database preventing full functionality testing
2. Strict address format validation limiting test coverage
3. Aggressive rate limiting affecting test execution
4. All graph API endpoints failing

The API shows promise but needs database seeding and some adjustments to be fully operational.
