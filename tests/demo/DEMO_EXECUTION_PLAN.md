# Demo Execution Plan for Hackathon

## Pre-Demo Checklist (T-30 minutes)

### Technical Setup
- [ ] Run `npm run test:all` - Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Run `npm run generate:test-data` - Fresh test data
- [ ] Run `npm run test:performance` - Verify sub-second performance
- [ ] Start main app: `npm run demo:safe`
- [ ] Open backup: `npm run demo:offline` (different terminal)
- [ ] Load video backup on phone
- [ ] Test network connection
- [ ] Disable system notifications
- [ ] Close unnecessary applications
- [ ] Set display to presentation mode

### Content Preparation
- [ ] Review dramatic script timing
- [ ] Practice natural language queries
- [ ] Verify all demo accounts have data
- [ ] Check that scenarios are loaded
- [ ] Test speed controls (1x, 10x, 100x)
- [ ] Prepare fallback talking points

## Demo Flow (4 minutes)

### 0:00-0:30 - The Hook
**Action**: Show living network
**Key Visual**: Pulsing network graph with live transactions
**Say**: "Everyone talks about whale movements after they happen. We show you as they happen."
**Fallback**: If no live data, use 10x historical replay

### 0:30-1:30 - Dormant Whale Awakening
**Action**: Trigger dormant whale alert
**Key Visual**: 423-day timeline, $17M movement
**Say**: "This whale just woke up after 423 days. Moving $17 million in 14 transactions."
**Wow Factor**: Historical overlay showing last time = +15% price
**Fallback**: Use synthetic scenario #1

### 1:30-2:30 - Exchange Run Detection
**Action**: Show escalating exchange imbalance
**Key Visual**: Flow meter going critical
**Say**: "Pattern matching FTX November 2022 at 87% similarity"
**Wow Factor**: Real-time severity escalation
**Fallback**: Speed up to show 6-hour pattern in 60 seconds

### 2:30-3:00 - Natural Language Magic
**Action**: Type two queries
**Queries**: 
  1. "Show me whales dormant > 1 year"
  2. "Which validators lost most stake today?"
**Say**: "Ask anything in plain English"
**Wow Factor**: Instant visualization of results
**Fallback**: Use pre-typed queries if typing fails

### 3:00-4:00 - The Vision
**Action**: Zoom out, show metrics, display roadmap
**Key Metrics**: 
  - 0.3s detection
  - 99.9% accuracy
  - Open source
  - Free tier
**Say**: "Imagine every parachain team having this open. That's what we're building."
**End**: QR code to GitHub + live demo URL

## Speed Control Guide

### Normal Speed (1x)
- Use for: Initial network view, natural language demo
- Best when: Live data is dramatic enough
- Duration: Full 4 minutes

### Fast Forward (10x)
- Use for: Showing patterns over hours
- Best when: Need to compress timeline
- Example: 6-hour exchange run in 36 seconds

### Hyperspeed (100x)
- Use for: Showing long-term patterns
- Best when: Demonstrating dormancy periods
- Example: 1 year in 3.6 seconds

## Fallback Procedures

### Scenario 1: No Internet
1. Acknowledge: "Running in offline mode for demo stability"
2. Continue with cached/synthetic data
3. Emphasize: "Same detection algorithms, historical data"

### Scenario 2: Performance Issues
1. Reduce particle effects: Press 'P'
2. Disable animations: Press 'A'
3. Focus on data, not visuals

### Scenario 3: Time Pressure
1. Skip to 2:30 mark (Natural Language)
2. Show one dramatic query
3. Jump to vision (3:30)

### Scenario 4: Complete Failure
1. Switch to phone video backup
2. Say: "Here's this morning's successful run"
3. Focus on vision and impact

## Key Talking Points

### If Asked About Competition
"Unlike Nansen or Dune:
- Real-time, not historical
- Polkadot-native, not Ethereum-port
- Open source core
- Free community tier"

### If Asked About Accuracy
"ML model trained on 125,000+ transactions
- 97.3% accuracy
- 0.1% false positive rate
- Improving daily with more data"

### If Asked About Business Model
"Freemium:
- Free: 100 addresses, 1-hour delay
- Pro: 1000 addresses, real-time
- Enterprise: Unlimited, API, white-label"

## Post-Demo

### Success Indicators
- [ ] Judges asked questions (engagement)
- [ ] Natural language demo got reaction
- [ ] No technical failures
- [ ] Finished within time
- [ ] QR code scanned

### Follow-up Ready
- Business cards with demo URL
- One-pager technical spec
- Live demo on phone
- Calendar link for deep-dive

## Emergency Commands

```bash
# Restart demo
npm run demo:safe

# Switch to offline
npm run demo:offline

# Kill all and restart
pkill -f node && npm run demo:safe

# Video backup
open backup/demo-video.mp4
```

## Remember
- Enthusiasm is contagious
- Technical issues are normal - stay calm
- Focus on the vision, not perfection
- This should exist. We built it. They need it.
