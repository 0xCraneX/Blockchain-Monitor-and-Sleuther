## Technical Requirements

### Animation Framework
- D3.js for data-driven animations
- Three.js for 3D network views
- Canvas for particle effects
- WebGL for performance

### Performance Optimizations
- Pre-render complex sequences
- Use GPU acceleration
- Lazy load heavy animations
- Fallback to static images on slow devices

### Sound Design (Optional)
- Subtle audio cues for alerts
- Rising tension for anomalies
- Satisfaction sound for successful detection
- Keep volume low for demo environment

### Color Palette
- Normal: Blue/Green (#00D4FF, #00FF88)
- Warning: Yellow/Orange (#FFD700, #FF8C00)
- Critical: Red/Pink (#FF0044, #FF0088)
- Background: Dark (#0A0A0A, #1A1A1A)
- Data: White/Light grey (#FFFFFF, #CCCCCC)

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Full animations
- Tablet: Simplified animations
- Mobile: Key frames only
- Projector: High contrast mode

## Demo Performance Tips

### Timing
- Let animations breathe - don't rush
- Pause at impact moments
- Use laser pointer for emphasis
- Have manual controls ready

### Engagement
- Ask "Can you see what's happening?" 
- Point out key moments
- Let audience react to big numbers
- Build tension before reveals

### Fallbacks
- Static screenshot sequences ready
- Can narrate over frozen frames
- Practice with no animations
- Have printed handouts as backup

### Stage Presence
- Stand to the side of screen
- Use hand gestures to guide attention
- Make eye contact during key points
- Let the visuals do the work

Remember: The visualizations should feel like a bloomberg terminal meets a spy movie - professional but exciting.
