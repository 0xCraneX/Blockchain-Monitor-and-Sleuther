## Security Incident Response

### Immediate Actions for Security Incidents
1. **Identify the threat**: Check security logs and monitoring alerts
2. **Isolate affected systems**: Use rate limiting and IP blocking if needed
3. **Assess impact**: Check what data or functionality was affected
4. **Contain the incident**: Block malicious traffic, disable compromised accounts
5. **Document everything**: Log all actions taken during incident response
